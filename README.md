# Marvel Comics App

The Marvel Comics App is a mobile application that allows users to explore and discover various Marvel comic books. It provides a user-friendly interface to browse through a collection of comics, search for specific titles, and view detailed information about each comic. 

## Introduction & main goals

* Browse a collection of Marvel comic books.

### Technologies used
* Flutter: A cross-platform framework for building mobile applications.
